Your header should contain the client logo and the main content should
 be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images 
 below it. Your footer will have two columns: the first column should 
 have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting 
 information. When it comes to styling, you'll have to create the 
 appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience. Remember, 
 you want to create intentional engagement!
