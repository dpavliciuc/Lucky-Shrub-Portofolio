            <img src="assets/bluebird.jpg" alt="bluebird" class="imgcard">
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">
              Blooms from mid-summer to fall (typically July through September).<br>
              The large flowers are known to attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds, which makes it an excellent choice for wildlife-friendly gardens.<br>
              Once established, Bluebird Hibiscus requires minimal care, making it great for gardeners who want a reliable, hardy plant with seasonal beauty.

            <img src="assets/AnnabelleHydrangea.jpg" class="imgcard" alt="">
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">
               Blooms from late spring to early summer, often starting in June. Hardiness Zones: Hardy in USDA Zones 3-9.<br>
               Tolerates a range of soil types and light conditions, making it ideal for shaded or partially shaded areas where many other plants struggle.<br>
               While it does require some attention to pruning, Annabelle is generally a low-maintenance shrub that doesn’t need much attention once established.

            <h1>Endless Summer Hydrangea</h1>
            <img src="assets/Endless Summer Hydrangea.jpg" class="imgcard" alt="">
            <p class="animate-on-scroll">
               A deciduous shrub with large, round flower clusters that can range from blue to pink, depending on soil pH. The flowers are usually around 6-8 inches in diameter.<br>
               It blooms repeatedly from early summer through fall, unlike many hydrangeas that bloom only once. <br>
               Easy to grow, but benefits from regular watering, especially in hotter climates. Pruning is best done in early spring, but since it blooms on both old and new wood, it’s more forgiving of pruning mistakes. <br>
